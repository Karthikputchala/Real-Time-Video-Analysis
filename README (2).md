# Real-time Person Detection and Scene  Recognition in Video Surveillance

Project is based on the combination of image recognition and the video detection
 

## Introduction

This project allows for the identification of individuals in video footage and the detection of the scene happening during their presence in real-time. This technology can be implemented in a 
variety of settings, such as security systems, retail stores, and public spaces. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze video footage and identify individuals based on their unique characteristics, such as their facial features.
